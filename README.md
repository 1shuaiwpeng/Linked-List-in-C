# data_structure_C
Linked list in C

This is a exercise project to use the Linked List ADS in C.

During this project, the related skills are these: pointers, structure, head file, typedef, dynamic allocation, makefile.

This project realizes the basic function to manage the students's number(ID) and score. The functions cover creating list, add information, insert, delete, find, delete_list, print_list. Because all the process related the students' information creation is realized in the structure defination of Student and function defination 'creatStd', it's easily to extend the contents of Student with only these two item changed. 

Later, maybe the function of List saving will be added with the file operating methods.
